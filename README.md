# es-next-pixel
Theme 'next-pixel' for [recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/) and based on 'recalbox-next' theme. Donwload links are available at the bottom, **do not clone or donwload master branch as it does not contain any images**.

This theme is designed to display a fullscreen image for every system that best defined it (or as best as possible) avoiding using ingame footage. Most of these systems will have a custom music that match that game.

It is based on recabox-next theme so you'll get all advantages of it (region settings, game list layout settings, etc..) + several options so you can get a visual that suits you. 

**It works best with 16/9 screens**.

Here are some configuration examples:

### Installation
To install theme drag and drop next-pixel folder into your recalbox/system/.emulationstation/themes folder. Then start/restart your recalbox.


### Options
- COLORSET 	: chose between several color configurations light, dark or game accent, game accent will colorize some elements using a color matching actual system image, some configuration may mix light, dark and game accent, try them out to find the best for you.
- ICONSET 	: chose icons used for bottom left help (same as recalbox-next).
- SYSTEMVIEW 	: chose beetwen vertical wheel or horizontal system view, for each one you have 3 options to display system info (4 lines info, all lines info or no info), **when using vertical wheel please use UI SETTINGS > TRANSITION STYLE > INSTANT for a better look and feel**.
- GAMELISTVIEW	: chose gamelist view (same as recalbox next but 4/3 where removed), for each one you can chose to display or hide "pixel" border.
- REGION		: chose your region to adjust logo/console images (same as recalbox-next).


### Multiple game themes
Some systems may contain several game themes, in that case system folder is duplicated with "2" suffix [folder]2 (for example cavestory2), if you prefer medias in that folder just remove or rename original folder so you can next rename [folder]2 to [folder] (then you need to restart recalbox if it was running).
Actual systems with multiple game themes (first one is default):
- cavestory : 2 images available
- psx : Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy VII
- snes : Zelda, Final Fantasy VI

### Missing systems
Next systems are not supported yet, they will display the same image as favorites/screenshots and play recalbox-next theme random music.
