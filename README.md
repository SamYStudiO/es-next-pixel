### Hi and welcome to Next Pixel theme for [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/)!
This theme is designed to display a full screen image for every system that best defined it (or as best as possible) avoiding using in game footage. Most of these systems will have a custom music and a custom rating icon that match that game.
It is based on recabox-next theme so you'll get all advantages of it (region settings, game list layout settings, etc..) + several options so you can get a visual that suits you. 

**Theme is compatible with 16:9 and 4:3 screens**.

Here are some screenshots using different theme settings:

### Installation
To install theme drag and drop next-pixel folder into your recalbox/system/.emulationstation/themes folder. Then choose next-pixel theme from recalbox options (UI SETTINGS > THEME SET).


### Options
- COLORSET 	: choose between several color configurations light, dark or game accent, game accent will colorize some elements using a color matching actual system image, some configuration may mix light, dark and game accent, try them out to find the best for you.
- ICONSET 	: choose icons used for bottom left help (same as recalbox-next).
- SYSTEMVIEW 	: choose beetwen vertical wheel or horizontal system view, for each one you have 3 options to display system info (4 lines info, all lines info or no info), **when using vertical wheel please use UI SETTINGS > TRANSITION STYLE > INSTANT for a better look and feel**.
- GAMELISTVIEW	: choose gamelist view layout, you may show/hide different elements.
- REGION		: choose your region to adjust logo/console images (same as recalbox-next).


### Multiple game themes
Some systems may contain several game themes, in that case system folder is duplicated with "2", "3", "x" suffix [folder]2, [folder]3, [folder]x (for example cavestory2), if you prefer medias in that folder just remove or rename original folder so you can next rename [folder]x to [folder] (then you need to restart recalbox if it was running).
Actual systems with multiple game themes :
- atarist : 1 game theme with 2 different images available
- cavestory : 1 game theme with 2 different images available
- lynx : 2 different game themes available
- ports : 2 different game themes available (1 with 2 different images available)
- psx : 2 different game themes available
- snes : 2 different game themes available


### Move a game theme to another system
Sometimes a game theme could match different systems and you may want to use a game theme with another system. To properly move a game theme to another system copy all files from any system folder **BUT data folder** and past them into another system folder where you want to apply that game theme.

### Download
Several packages are available depending on your screen ratio and resolution. Actually theme fully supports 16:9 and 4:3 screens.

#### 16:9 screens
3 packages are available with 1080p images (full hd screens, 4K, 8K), 720p images (hd screens) or 480p images (intended for Raspberry users).

**If you are a Raspberry Pi user please read carefully next lines (PC/Odroid users can skip to download links and grab package that match best their screen resolution).
Raspberry Pi may lead to memory issues when using a lot of images. 720p package is the right way to go even if you're on a big screen tv 1080p/4K/8K. I highly recommend to force recalbox to run at 720p if your screen is running higher resolution, as it will improve performances and images quality**. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)), from this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following:
- hdmi_group=1
- hdmi_mode=4

Don't forget to remove '#' char on those lines if present.

If you still have issues with 720p (mainly images replaced with white rectangle) **and you already have forced recalbox to run at 720p** then you should switch to 480p package, images quality will be less sharp but you should be able to use lots of systems without issues.

**[DOWNLOAD es-next-pixel-720p-1.0](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-next-pixel/archive/720p.zip)**

**[DOWNLOAD es-next-pixel-480p-1.0](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-next-pixel/archive/480p.zip)**

#### 4:3 screens
One package is available with 1024x768 images but compatible with any 4:3 resolutions. **If you're using a screen with higher resolution than 1024x768, I highly recommend to force recalbox to run at the same resolution as it will improve performances and images quality**. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)), from this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following:
- hdmi_group=2
- hdmi_mode=16

Don't forget to remove '#' char on those lines if present.

### Final words
