# es-next-pixel
Theme *next-pixel* for [recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/) and based on *recalbox-next* theme. Download links are available at the bottom, **do not clone or download master branch as it does not contain any images**.

This theme is designed to display a fullscreen image for every system that best defined it (or as best as possible) avoiding using in game footage. Most of these systems will have a custom music that match that game.

It is based on recabox-next theme so you'll get all advantages of it (region settings, game list layout settings, etc..) + several options so you can get a visual that suits you. 

Theme is compatible with 16:9, 16:10 and 4:3 screens.

Here are some screenshots using different theme settings:

### Installation
To install theme drag and drop next-pixel folder into your recalbox/system/.emulationstation/themes folder. Then start/restart your recalbox and choose next-pixel theme from recalbox options (UI SETTINGS > THEME SET).


### Options
- COLORSET 	: chose between several color configurations light, dark or game accent, game accent will colorize some elements using a color matching actual system image, some configuration may mix light, dark and game accent, try them out to find the best for you.
- ICONSET 	: chose icons used for bottom left help (same as recalbox-next).
- SYSTEMVIEW 	: chose beetwen vertical wheel or horizontal system view, for each one you have 3 options to display system info (4 lines info, all lines info or no info), **when using vertical wheel please use UI SETTINGS > TRANSITION STYLE > INSTANT for a better look and feel**.
- GAMELISTVIEW	: chose gamelist view (same as recalbox next but 4/3 where removed), for each one you can chose to display or hide "pixel" border.
- REGION		: chose your region to adjust logo/console images (same as recalbox-next).


### Multiple game themes
Some systems may contain several game themes, in that case system folder is duplicated with "2" suffix [folder]2 (for example cavestory2), if you prefer medias in that folder just remove or rename original folder so you can next rename [folder]2 to [folder] (then you need to restart recalbox if it was running).
Actual systems with multiple game themes (first one is default):
- cavestory : 2 images available
- psx : Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy VII
- snes : Zelda, Final Fantasy VI
- atarist : 2 images available


### Missing systems
Next systems are not supported yet, they will display the same image as favorites/screenshots and play recalbox-next theme random music.

### Download
Several packages are available depending on your screen ratio and resolution. Actually theme fully supports 16:9, 16:10 and 4:3 screens.

#### 16:9 and 16:10 screens
2 packages are available with 1080p (full hd screens) or 720p (hd screens) images.

Some devices like Raspberry Pi may lead to memory issues when using a lot of images especially in 1080p. If you have any issues with image loading you should switch to 720p version. When switching to 720p from a 1080p screen, i highly recommend to force recalbox to run at 720p as it will greatly improve image quality. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)), from this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following:
- hdmi_group=1
- hdmi_mode=4

Don't forget to remove '#' char on those lines if present.

16:10 users, you'll have to remove and rename one file to make it fully compatible with this ratio when using vertical wheel, after installing theme, go to [theme folder]/data/systemviews, then remove *vertical_wheel_common* file and rename *vertical_wheel_common_16_10* to *vertical_wheel_common* and that's it!
