### ![gb](https://www.countryflags.io/gb/shiny/32.png)![us](https://www.countryflags.io/us/shiny/32.png) Hi and welcome to [Next Pixel theme](https://samystudio.github.io/es-theme-next-pixel/) for [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/)
This theme is designed to display a full screen image for every system that best defined it (or as best as possible) avoiding using in game footage. Most of these systems will have a custom music and a custom rating icon that match that game.
It is based on recabox-next theme so you'll get all advantages of it (region settings, game list layout settings, etc..) + several options so you can get a visual that suits you. 

**Theme is configured by default to use a custom mix to scrap your game images, please read carefully documentation below to get more info even if you don't want to use it as you'll have to adjust theme GAMELISTVIEW option to get it work properly with others mixes**.

**Theme is compatible with Recalbox 6.1+ and with 16:9, 4:3 and small 4:3 screens like GPi CASE**.

Here are some screenshots using different theme settings :

### Installation
To install theme drag and drop es-theme-next-pixel-xxx folder into your recalbox/themes folder. Then choose es-theme-next-pixel-xxx theme from Recalbox options (UI SETTINGS > THEME > THEME SET).

This theme support Randomizer script, check this [link](https://github.com/Voljega/scripts4recalbox/tree/master/Randomizer) to get more info (**Warning : from installation guide "Copying theme/random directory..." is not required as this theme already includes it with some extra customization**). 


### Options
- **THEME COLORSET** : choose between several color configurations light, dark or game accent, game accent will colorize some elements using a color matching actual system image, some configuration may mix light, dark and game accent, try them out to find the best for you.
- **THEME ICONSET** : choose icons used for bottom left help (same as recalbox-next).
- **THEME MENU** : choose Recalbox menu style (same as recalbox-next with an exlucisve style for Next Pixel thème).
- **THEME SYSTEMVIEW** : choose beetwen vertical wheel or horizontal system view, for each one you have 3 options to display system info (4 lines info, all lines info or no info), **when using vertical wheel please use UI SETTINGS > THEME > TRANSITION STYLE > INSTANT for a better look and feel**.
- **THEME GAMELISTVIEW** : choose gamelist view layout, you may show/hide different elements and for each one you may adjust for **Next Pixel mix** or others mixes. **If you do not want to use Next Pixel mix select any "others mixes" option here or you will get some weird graphical assets overlaying your scraped images** (check *Scraping / Next Pixel mix* below for more info).
- **THEME REGION** : choose your region to adjust logo/console images (same as recalbox-next).


### Scraping / Next Pixel mix
Next Pixel theme now includes its own custom mix to make your game screenshots and video snaps integration even better. If you never heard of mixes, they're just these images you may download along with game info/description using Recalbox internal scraper or using an external scraper like [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/). Better than a long description here are 2 captures using standard mix and using Next Pixel mix.

**Standard mix**

**To get more info on how to use Next Pixel mix, check [documentation](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-theme-next-pixel/blob/master/data/mix/README.md).**

**If you do not want to use Next Pixel mix select any "others mixes" option from theme GAMELISTVIEW settings or you will get some weird graphical assets overlaying your scraped images**. Press Start > UI SETTINGS > THEME > THEME CONFIGURATION > THEME GAMELISTVIEW > choose any layout with "others mixes".


### Multiple system game themes
Some systems may contain several game themes, in that case system folder is duplicated with "_2", "_3", "_x" suffix [folder]_2, [folder]_3, [folder]_x (for example cavestory_2), if you prefer medias in that folder just remove or rename original folder so you can next rename [folder]_x to [folder] (then you need to restart Recalbox if it was running).
Actual systems with multiple game themes :
- atarist : 1 game theme with 2 different images available
- cavestory : 1 game theme with 2 different images available
- gameboy : 3 different game themes available
- megadrive : 2 different game themes available
- n64 : 4 different game themes available
- nds : 2 different game themes available
- nes : 2 different game themes available
- ps3 : 2 different game themes available
- psp : 2 different game themes available
- psx : 2 different game themes available
- segacd : 2 different game themes available
- snes : 3 different game themes available
- wii : 2 different game themes available

To help you choose, all systems images are visible from [Next Pixel website](https://samystudio.github.io/es-theme-next-pixel/) or if you can't make your choice you may consider using random script so each time you start Recalbox you get a different game theme, read next section for more info.


### Random system game themes
Next Pixel theme includes a custom start script for Recalbox to randomly change systems game themes. As seen previoulsy some systems may contains multiple game themes, when using this script such systems will randomly load a game theme when Recalbox start. This script named "S997next-pixel-random-system-game-theme" is located at your Next Pixel theme root installation. You need to drop this file in your Recalbox */etc/init.d/* folder. To do so you can use command line tool with PuTTy or tool such as [WinSCP](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Network-access-with-WinSCP-(EN)) to connect to your Recalbox. You may read [this](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Add-your-own-startup-script-(EN)) to get more info on starting scripts. 
**Don't forget to allow write access before droping your file**.
- If you're using PuTTy use *mount -o remount,rw /* command.
- If you're using WinSCP open console (Ctrl + T), enter command *mount -o remount,rw /* and click Execute.

**Note script assumes you are using default Next Pixel theme folder installation**. If you changed Next Pixel installation folder name you need to adjust script or restore your Next Pixel theme installation folder name.
- If you want to adjust script, open the file with a text editor and adjust second line to match your Next Pixel theme installation folder *cd /recalbox/share/themes/[set your next pixel theme folder here]/*
- If you prefer to restore your installation folder name here are the right name depending on your package :
  - **1080p** : es-theme-next-pixel-1080p
  - **720p** : es-theme-next-pixel-720p
  - **480p** : es-theme-next-pixel-480p
  - **crt** : es-theme-next-pixel-crt
  - **crt-small** : es-theme-next-pixel-crt-small

**Once your script is dropped in the right folder don't forget to change file permission so Recalbox is allowed to execute it**.
- If you're using PuTTy use *chmod +x S997next-pixel-random-system-game-theme* commmand.
- If you're using WinSCP right click on *S997next-pixel-random-system-game-theme* file and from *Permissions* check all "X" execution boxes.


### Move a game theme to another system
Sometimes a game theme could match different systems and you may want to use a game theme with another system. To properly move a game theme to another system copy all files from any system folder **BUT data folder** and past them into another system folder where you want to apply that game theme.

### Download
Several packages are available depending on your screen ratio and resolution. Actually theme fully supports 16:9 and 4:3 screens.

#### 16:9 screens
3 packages are available with 1080p images (full hd screens, 4K, 8K), 720p images (hd screens) or 480p images (intended for Raspberry users).

**If you are a Raspberry Pi user please read carefully next lines (PC/Odroid users can skip to download links and grab package that match best their screen resolution)**.
Raspberry Pi may lead to memory issues when using a lot of images. 720p package is the right way to go even if you're on a big screen tv 1080p/4K/8K. **I highly recommend to force Recalbox to run at 720p if your screen is running higher resolution, as it will improve performances and images quality**. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)) using PuTTy or WinSCP.

**Don't forget to allow write access before modify your file**.
- If you're using PuTTy use *mount -o remount,rw /boot* commmand.
- If you're using WinSCP open console (Ctrl + T), enter command *mount -o remount,rw /boot* and click Execute.

From this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following :
- hdmi_group=1
- hdmi_mode=4

Don't forget to remove '#' char on those lines if present.

If you still have issues with 720p (mainly images replaced with white rectangle) **and you already have forced Recalbox to run at 720p** you may try to allocate more gpu memory. Edit the same [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)) file, this time search for *gpu_mem_1024=448* and set it to *gpu_mem_1024=512* and once again **Don't forget to allow write access before modify your file**.

**Warning : PSP emulator may not work anymore, so if you're not using PSP system this shouldn't be a problem**.

If you don't want to change memory settings or you're using PSP system then you should switch to 480p package, images quality will be less sharp but you should be able to use lots of systems without issues.

[Download](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-theme-next-pixel/releases/tag/v1.0) previous packages for Recalbox 6.0 or lower.

#### 4:3 screens
2 packages are available with 1024x768 images and 320x240 images, if you're using a screen with higher resolution than 320x240 pick **crt package**, if you're using 320x240 or lower screen (like GPi CASE) pick **crt-small package**. **If you're using 1024x768 package with a screen with higher resolution than 1024x768, I highly recommend to force Recalbox to run at the same resolution as it will improve performances and images quality**. To do so you'll have to edit [config.txt](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Edit-the-config.txt-file-(EN)) using PuTTy or [WinSCP](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Network-access-with-WinSCP-(EN)).

**Don't forget to allow write access before modify your file**.
- If you're using PuTTy use *mount -o remount,rw /boot* commmand.
- If you're using WinSCP open console (Ctrl + T), enter command *mount -o remount,rw /boot* and click Execute.

From this file search for *hdmi_group* and *hdmi_mode* and set both as following :
